		GDGSILIGURI is a newly developing community. Being associated with 
this community directly or indirectly, we feel that we should be responsible for even a slightest
development of this community to grow. So we are coming up building an app for gdgsiliguri.
		
#2.Project Plan:
		This is a project regarding making an app for GDGSiliguri which is having a 
chat bot with the name Cynthia, helpful to reply querries or unsignificatnt texts which are expected to have.
 It also Welcomes  any  newly logged in member in the gdgsiliguri community app. 


	# 2.1Why this Project:		
		
		During the organisation of any event by a Community, more than often
participants or even the organising members come up with various querries which are
expected to be answered by the Comminuty core members. But sometime it is not likely
when they keep on texting community members individually and even same type of querries
may arise from different members. So a solution may be a chat bot assistant available in an app
that can be able to  answer  all the querries individually.
 
		
	# 2.2Technologies used:
		
		Technologies which are used in this project is Slack.

		#2.2.1Dependencies:		
				Dialogflow:
					Dialogflow is a Google service that runs 
		on Google Cloud Platform, letting you scale to hundreds of millions of users.

	
	# 2.3Benefit for the Community: 

		The Community members should not have to continuously Text back to 
	such commomly arrising querries and even unsignificant texts, and on the other side 
	the app users can have a great talk with  Cynthia.
